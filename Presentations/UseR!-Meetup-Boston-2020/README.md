# Coronavirus propagation modeling, useR! Boston April 2020
***Tutorial presentation***   

The 
[extended abstract of the presentation](https://github.com/antononcube/SystemModeling/blob/master/Presentations/UseR!-Meetup-Boston-2020/ExtendedAbstract.md)
was loosely followed. 
Here is the (main) presentation mind-map:

(Note that mind-map's PDF has hyperlinks. Also, see the folder 
[Presentation-aids](https://github.com/antononcube/SystemModeling/raw/master/Presentations/UseR!-Meetup-Boston-2020/Presentation-aids).
)

Approximately 70% of the presentation was based on an R-programmed software monad for epidemiology compartmental models,
[ECMMon-R](https://github.com/antononcube/ECMMon-R), [AAr2].
For the rest were used frameworks, simulations, and graphics made with
[Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica), [AAr1],
and
[Wolfram System Modeler](https://www.wolfram.com/system-modeler/) . 

The presentation was given online (because of COVID-19) using Zoom. 
[190 people registered](https://www.meetup.com/Boston-useR/events/269304135).
Nearly 70 showed up (and maybe 60 stayed throughout.)

[A similar presentation](https://github.com/antononcube/SystemModeling/tree/master/Presentations/OMLDS-Meetup-March-2020)
was given two weeks prior for [OMLDS](https://www.meetup.com/Orlando-MLDS/events/269445903/).
