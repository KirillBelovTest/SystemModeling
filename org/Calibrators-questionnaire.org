* Introduction
- In this document are listed questions for different aspects of system models calibration.
  - System Dynamics is the main modeling paradigm.
** Roles
- There are three types of people dealing with the models:
  - Modeler, who develops and implements the model and prepares it for calibration.
  - Calibrator, who calibrates the model with different data for different parameters.
  - Stakeholder, who requires different features of the model and outcomes from different scenario play-outs.
- There are two main calibration scenarios:
  - Modeler and Calibrator are the same person
  - Modeler and Calibrator are different persons
- Model development and calibration is most likely going to be an iterative process.
- Hence it is good idea to keep track (a journal) of the model decisions, calibration process, problems encountered and their resolution, etc.
** Process
- It is assumed that each model calibration is done either for model development purposes or for a scenario play-out study.
- It is assumed in this document that the model has matured development-wise and model calibration is done in a (more) formal way.
  - Stakeholder requires certain scenarios to be investigated.
  - Modeler prepares the model for those scenarios
  - Stakeholder and Modeler formulate a *calibration request*.
  - Calibrator uses the specifications from the calibration request to:
    - Calibrate the model
    - Derive model outcomes results
    - Provide model qualitative results
    - Provide model sensitivity analysis results
** Calibration request
- The calibration request should specify:
  - Data to be used
  - Calibration parameters
  - Model outcomes to focus on
  - Model properties to focus on
** Why those questions?
- The list of questions below should help both Modeler and Calibrator to:
  - Have a more streamlined process of communication
  - Address problems of model application and deployment
  - Keep track of model evolution due to iterative model-and-calibrate processes
** Why the questions discuss notebooks?
- The following questions assume that models are developed and run
  with Mathematica.
- Currently most of SystemModeling models are (mostly) run through
  Mathematica notebooks.
** System Dynamics models
- Most of the SystemModeling models are System Dynamics models.
- Hence the questions below discuss stocks (e.g. people who are infected) and rates (e.g. number of contacts per person per day.)
