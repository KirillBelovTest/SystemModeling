Let's break down the System Dynamics model for two states at war into groups of stocks, rates, and relationships:

**State A & State B (both states have similar stocks and rates):**

**Stocks**:
1. **Total Population**: Represents the entire population of the state.
2. **Economic Production Population (EPP)**: The segment of the population responsible for economic production and from which soldiers are recruited.
3. **Soldiers**: Trained individuals ready for combat. They are sourced from the EPP and from the recruits after training.
4. **Recruits**: Individuals undergoing training to become soldiers. They are drawn from the EPP.
5. **Support Personnel**: People who support the soldiers but are not directly involved in combat.
6. **Factories**: Facilities responsible for producing weapons, ammunition, and other war supplies.
7. **Weapons**: Stockpile of weapons.
8. **Ammunition**: Stockpile of ammunition.
9. **Imported Essential War Raw Materials**: Raw materials imported from other countries, essential for war.
10. **Harvested Essential War Raw Materials**: Raw materials sourced domestically, essential for war.
11. **Will to Fight**: Represents the motivation or morale of the state to continue the war. It's influenced by propaganda and the number of soldier deaths.

**Rates**:
1. **Rate of Importing Raw Materials**: The speed at which essential war raw materials are imported.
2. **Rate of Harvesting Raw Materials Domestically**: The speed at which essential war raw materials are sourced or harvested within the state.
3. **Training Rate**: The speed at which recruits are trained to become soldiers.
4. **Production Rate**: The rate at which weapons, ammunition, and other supplies are produced for new recruits and the existing soldiers.

**Relationships**:
- Soldiers are sourced from the EPP and from recruits once they complete their training.
- The production of weapons, ammunition, and other supplies depends on the availability of essential war raw materials, which can either be imported or harvested domestically.
- The will to fight is influenced by propaganda efforts and is negatively affected by the number of soldier deaths.

In essence, this model captures the dynamics of a state preparing for and engaging in warfare, detailing the resources they have, 
how they use them, and the factors that influence their readiness and willingness to fight. 
The same model applies to both State A and State B, with the dynamics between them influencing each state's stocks and rates.
